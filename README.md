Dishwasher Production Data Analysis & Predictive Maintenance

This project focuses on analyzing manufacturing sensor data and building predictive models for identifying potential product failures on a production line.
It simulates the type of analysis performed in R&D and Quality Engineering teams, similar to processes used in companies such as Bosch / Beko / Arçelik.

🔍 Project Goals

Analyze production sensor data to discover patterns and correlations

Clean and preprocess large datasets

Visualize operational metrics and detect anomalies

Build a machine learning model for failure prediction

Generate insights that can support R&D, product quality, and operational optimization

🧰 Technologies & Tools

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-Learn

Jupyter Notebook

(Optional) SQL Integration

(Optional) XGBoost / LightGBM

📚 Dataset

The project uses the Bosch Production Line Performance Dataset from Kaggle:

👉 https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bosch-production-line-performance

This dataset includes:

thousands of sensor measurements

product completion status (pass/fail)

timestamps and production stages

It is one of the largest real-world manufacturing datasets available publicly.
